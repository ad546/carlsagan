				<h2>Cosmos</h2>
				<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3237312-cosmos">
					<p>"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p>“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, 
					the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. 
					We are made of starstuff.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p>“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. 
					We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last 
					to set sail for the stars.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>- <em>Carl Sagan</em></p>
				<p><b><ins>Cosmos</ins></b> is a popular (best selling scientific book until 1988) scientific non-fiction book written by Carl Sagan in 1980. It was Carl Sagan's way of 
					helping those who wished to learn about the universe do so in an encouraging way. This book looks to relay facts about the universe, as known in 1980, to its audience while
					also imploring readers to imagine the possibilities of exploring the universe around them. Its popularity was helped by the making of <em>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</em>, a tv show that aired around the
					same time as the publishing of this book.</p>
